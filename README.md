# Mobile-Phone-Price-Prediction
Machine Learning project to predict mobile phone prices using Flipkart scraped data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting mobile phone prices using Machine Learning techniques based on their technical specifications such as RAM, internal storage, battery capacity, camera features, and other hardware attributes.
The dataset used in this project was collected through web scraping publicly available mobile phone listings from Flipkart for educational purposes. After data collection, extensive preprocessing and feature engineering were performed to prepare the data for model training.
Multiple Machine Learning models were trained and evaluated to analyze how different features influence mobile phone pricing, and the best-performing model was selected based on standard evaluation metrics.
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data collection to model evaluation.
